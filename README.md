## Features

1. Rotation-On simulation. (Device rotates and so does screen and buttons).
2. Firebase Storage is used. Songs are streamed from Google's high speed Firebase Storage.
3. Instructions are mentioned on the screen. No room for any type of confusion.
4. Action buttons light up when a song is being played.
5. Lightening fast React JS based app.
6. More songs can be added to the database with small changes here and there in the code. (Currently 6 songs for illustration)
7. Swipe Enabled, i.e. One can swipe through the 4 buttons given in the circular portion to navigate through the menu.
8. Songs can be switched without going to the All Songs screen again and again. (using the left and right arrow buttons provided in the Circular Actions Button Section).

## How to use?

1. In the group of circular action buttons section (See the screenshots), the upper-most button is the menu button. left and right buttons are navigation buttons(to navigate in All songs only). The bottom-most button is the Play/Pause button to stop or play the current song.
2. To navigate in the menu, just swipe clockwise if you want to select an item which is available below the currently selected item. And similarly, swipe anti-clockwise if you want to select an item which is available above the currently selected item.
3. Go to All Songs in the Music Section to view a list of all songs available currently on the Cloud Storage. (Make sure you are connected to the internet).
4. To play a song click the "Select" button. Also to select a section from the list of Sections in the menu, press "Select Button".
5. To change a song while another one is being played, click on the left or right arrow buttons and click on the Play/Pause button on the bottom.
6. To rotate the screen, press the small circular button with `Rotation` symbol on the right mid on the app.
7. Songs can be found in the Music/All Songs Section. All other pages are dummy pages for illustration purposes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
